**Brain Tumor Radiogenomic Classification**    
Currently, genetic analysis of cancer requires surgery to extract a tissue sample. Then it can take several weeks to determine the genetic characterization of the tumor. Depending upon the results and type of initial therapy chosen, a subsequent surgery may be necessary. If an accurate method to predict the genetics of the cancer through imaging (i.e., radiogenomics) alone could be developed, this would potentially minimize the number of surgeries and refine the type of therapy required.  
We will predict the genetic subtype of glioblastoma using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to train and test your model to detect for the presence of MGMT promoter methylation.  
If successful, you'll help brain cancer patients receive less invasive diagnoses and treatments. The introduction of new and customized treatment strategies before surgery has the potential to improve the management, survival, and prospects of patients with brain cancer.
